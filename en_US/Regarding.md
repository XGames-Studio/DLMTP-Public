1. We encourage and support players to publish their gameplay content of DLMTP on video platforms, including level clearances, online gameplay moments, and leaderboard challenges. Players are welcome to mention the game's official account in the video description. We will consider reposting high-quality content.

2. Since none of the in-game materials in DLMTP have obtained authorization and recognition from the original creators, we do not want players to use these materials for any commercial purposes. This is not beneficial to us, nor to you.
