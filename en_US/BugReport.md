# Bug Report Guidelines

If you encounter any issues while playing the game, please contact the developers in a timely manner.

You can provide feedback through the following methods:

### In-game Feedback Function (Recommended)
- If you encounter an issue during gameplay and can switch to the settings interface, please submit your feedback via the bug report section in the settings interface.

### Feedback in the QQ Group
- If you are unable to open the settings interface to submit your feedback, please report the issue in the group "in detail", "completely", and "clearly".
- Please include your device information, device type (PC / Android / iOS), device version (e.g., Windows version), the issue you encountered, and the steps to reproduce it.

Providing effective bug reports will help us improve the game.
